Building Baseliner logs the story of the development of Baseliner, an app for Apple platforms that tracks tennis scores.

I will develop Baseliner in the open on [GitHub](https://github.com/Bixelcog/Baseliner). A goal of this project is to provide sample code for a variety of Apple's APIs in the context of a real application. 

Baseliner will adhere to a set of technical restrictions to help make the project applicable to the widest audience.

- **Modern**: Baseliner requires iOS 13.
- **No third-party code dependencies**: Baseliner will only use code I write and code from Apple's SDKs.
- **SwiftUI**: Baseliner will use SwiftUI when possible.
- **Testing**: Baseliner will include automated tests. 

At a high-level, Baseliner should support the following features. 

- Users should be able to manage a list of players.
- Users should be able to manage their tennis matches, including tracking opponents, partners, and scores.
- Users should be able to view reports of the results of the matches.

The first iteration of Baseliner will be for iOS and iPadOS.
